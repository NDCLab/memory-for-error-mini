%%%%% Information about dataset and analysis procedures %%%%%%
%5. Number of channels
nbchan = 64;

%6. What kind of data? Resting State or Event-Related Data
RestorEvent = 0; %1 = rest, 0 = event

%7. What are your conditions of interest if using Event-Related Data? This
%naming convention should come from the Edit_events.m script provided.
%Note: not needed for resting state data.
Conds = {'resp_i_0','resp_i_1', 'resp_c_1', 'stim_i_0', 'stim_i_1','stim_c_1'}; % resp_i_0 = incong error response; resp_i_1 = incong correct response

%8. Minimum number of trials to analyze
mintrialnum = 6; %If the participant does not have enough trials in a condition based on this cutoff, a "notenoughdata.mat" file will be saved into save_location.

%9. Would you like to baseline correct your data? NOTE: ICPS calculated over time will not be baseline corrected.
BaselineCorrect = 1; %1=Yes, 0=No

%10. What time period would you like to use to baseline correct
BaselineTime = [-400 -200];
%Put in time in ms for event-related data. For example, if you want to baseline correct from -100 to 0ms before the 
% event for evernt-related paradigms, put [-100 0].

%11. Would you like to downsample the output to 125Hz? This is done after the time-frequency computations and will have minor impacts on the resolution. 
%We recommend downsampling to reduce file size for ease of storage. All data will be initially downsampled to 250Hz. 
Downsample = 1; %0=No, 1=Yes  

%12. Dataset Name - will be appended to the saved files
DatasetName = '_miniMFE';

%%%%% Settings for Time-Frequency Measures %%%%%

%13. Minimum and Maximum Frequency, Number of Frequency Bins, and range cycles to calculate complex Morlet wavelet decomposition
min_freq = 1;
max_freq = 30; % check
num_frex = 59; % number of frequency bins between minimum and maximum frequency
range_cycles = [3 10]; % wavelet cycles: min 3 max 10

%%%%% Questions about phase-based measures %%%%%

%14. Would you like to calculate inter-trial phase synchrony (ITPS) in addition to TF?
ITPS_calc = 1; %(1=yes,0=no)

%15. Would you like to subsample trials? This is recommended for event-related paradigms, 
% especially when there are uneven numbers of trials in conditions. 
Subsample = 1; %1=Yes, 0=No
%How many trials to pull for each subsample? 
NumTrialsPulled = 6;
%How many times to do subsampling? We recommend doing at least 10 subsamples and to have the possiblility of using all your data
% (e.g., if you have 150 trials, do 15 subsamples of 10 trials).
NumSubsamples = 100; % Kia: My task 160 trials. So, 50 subsamples seems to be good to cover them all.

%16. Would you like to calculate inter-channel phase synchrony (ICPS or wPLI) in addition to TF?
ICPS_calc = 1; %(1=yes,0=no) 

%17. Would you like to caluclate coherence or weighted phaselagidx?
ICPS_or_wPLI = 0; %(1=coherence, 0=wPLI)

%18. Inter-channel phase synchrony over trials or connectivity over time?
% Kia: over trials results in a frequency by time matrix and over time
% results in a frequency by trials, which removes the time dimension. 
TimeOrTrials = 1; %0 = over time, 1 = over trials
% NOTE: over time calculations will not be able to be subsampled or
% baseline corrected

%19. Type of Connectivity to compute 
ConnectType = 1; %(0= all-to-all connectivity; 1=seed-based connectivity)
%If seed based, choose seed and which electrodes to compute connectivity:
Seed = '1'; % Kia: FCz (i.e, 1 on the BV electrode system) as an MFC seed electrode. 
% I will look at 33 electrode as a seed next. 
%Elecs4Connect = { '4' '6' '36' '39' '7' '9' '40' '42'}; % Kia: needs George help
Elecs4Connect = { '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9' '10' '11' '12' '13' '14'
    '15' '16' '17' '18' '19' '20' '21' '22' '23' '24' '25' '26' '27' '28' '29' '30'
    '31' '32' '33' '34' '35' '36' '37' '38' '39' '40' '41' '42' '43' '44' '45' '46' '47' ''};
% 20. Create List of subjects to loop through
subnum = dir([data_location filesep '*.set']); % Use regex to find your files 
subject= {subnum.name};
for ii=1:length(subject)
    subject_list{ii}=subject{ii};   
end

% We recommend checking that your subject list looks like you would expect:
